#   The exercise comes first (with a few extras if you want the extra challenge or want to spend more time), followed by a discussion. Enjoy!

#   Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

#   Extras:

#   If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.

#   Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

a = 0.0

n = num % 2

if n == 0 :
    print("The entered number is Even")
else :
    print("The entered number is Odd")
